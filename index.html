        <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
        <h2>ACT 1</h2>
        <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
        <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br> In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, <br>From ancient grudge
            break to new mutiny,<br> Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br> From forth the fatal loins of
            these two foes<br> A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
            Whose misadventured piteous overthrows <br>
            Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
            The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br> And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br> Which,
            but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
            Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
            The which if you with patient ears attend, <br>
            What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
        <h2>SCENE 1. Verona. A public place.</h2>
        <p><i>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and buckters.</i></p>
        <h2>SAMPSON</h2>
        <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not crazy coals.</p>
        <h2>GREGORY</h2>
        <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>

        <h2 class="h2_3">What is HTML?</h2>
        <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language <span class="html">(HTML)</span></b> is the standard markup language for
            creating web pages and web applications. <br><br>
            Web browsers receive <span class="html">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and
            render the documents into multimedia web pages. <span class="html">HTML</span> describes the structure of a
            web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br><br>
            <span class="html">HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span class="html">HTML</span> pages.
            With <span class="html">HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
            embedded into the rendered page. <span class="html">HTML</span> provides a means to create structured
            documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
            other items. <span class="html">HTML</span> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
            Tags such as <span class="teg">&lt;img/&gt;</span> and <span class="teg">&lt;input&gt;</span> directly
            introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <span class="teg"> &lt;p&gt;</span> surround and provide
            information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the
            <span clas="html">HTML</span> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h2_3">Markup</h2>
        <p><span class="html">HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called <i>tags</i>
            (and their <i>attributes</i>), character-based <i>data types, character references</i> and <i>entity
                references</i>. <span class="html"> HTML</span> tags most commonly come in pairs like <span
                class="teg">&lt;h1&gt;</span> and <span class="teg">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>, although some represent <i>empty
                elements</i> and so are unpaired, for example <span class="teg">&lt;img/&gt;</span>. The first tag in
            such a pair is the <i>start tag</i>, and the second is the <i>end tag</i> (they are also called <i>opening
                tags</i> and <i>closing tags</i>),
            <br><br>Another important component is the <span class="html">HTML</span> <i>document type declaration</i>,
            which triggers standards mode rendering.
            <br><br>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
